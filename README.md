One of the most serious issues in the telecom sector is churn.
According to research, the top four wireless carriers in the United States have a monthly churn rate of 1.9 percent to 2%.
The fundamental driver is a pressing need for firms to keep existing consumers, as well as the steep expense of gaining new ones.

With the use of machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XG Boost, the suggested predictive model finds the features that have a significant impact on customer attrition.
